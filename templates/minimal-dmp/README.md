# Minimal DMP template (v0.1)

This folder is a copy-paste starting point for a valid DMP v0.1 package.

**Replace the contents, not the structure.**

What to do:
- Keep the required files at the package root.
- Replace the minimal example logic with your real model and evaluation.
- Keep the schema, solver config, and decision card aligned with your model.

What not to do:
- Do not add new required files or custom runner hooks.
- Do not move required files into subdirectories.
